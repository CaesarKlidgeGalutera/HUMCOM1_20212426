        <p>&emsp; &emsp;Festival celebrating the use of bambanti or scarecrow by the Isabelinos in their vast farmlands
            to protect its crops is highlighted by an agro-industrial trade fair participated by
            the 34 towns and three cities of Isabela. A bambanti village is set up to house all
            the activities during the festival to include agri-ecotourism exhibits, bambanti
            installations, Isabela Singing Idol and Glee, festival street dance competition with
            Festival King and Queen, and a grand fireworks display.</p>

    <div class="festival2">
        <img src="../images/bambanti-festival-2019.jpg">
        <p> &emsp; &emsp; The festival started and got
         institutionalized around the early months of 1997. It was made to celebrate and represent over 34
         municipalities in the City of Isabela that have been one of the few with rich agricultural history. 
        It is also to remember that the Philippines, up to this date, belongs to the few countries that could 
        greatly provide agricultural needs, both in the international and domestic trade industries.<br> <br> &emsp; &emsp;This festival is also
     renowned for the marvelous and colorful display of scarecrows all across the entire festival. Even mascots use the scarecrow costume.
     However, it's not just for fun or something that is used because it can be seen in crop fields. It actually has a deeper meaning
    into it where it symbolizes or signifies different farmer's traits such as endurance, resoluteness, and diligent spirit. <br> <br> &emsp; &emsp;
    The scarecrow is usually built with materials from what crops they have produced in their municipality or region. 
    An example would be a rice crop-built scarecrow competing against another built from sugar cane crops and other materials. Not only you'd 
    see how hardworking the farmers are, but you'd also see how creative and artistic they are when it comes to designing their scarecrow model.</p>
