            <h1>History</h1>
            <img src="../images/Queen_Isabela.jpg">
            <p> &emsp; &emsp; Isabela's early origins date back to the Stone Age over 25,000 years ago when a pygmy race called the Agtas
                 were the first indigenous people to inhabit the Philippines. They were the ancestors of the Dumagats, who
                  still roam the mountainous forestlands of Eastern Isabela and the shorelines of Coastal Isabela. For many
                   centuries, the ancient Agtas subsisted as hunters, gatherers, and fisherfolk. <br> <br> &emsp; &emsp; Five thousand 
                   years ago, a wave of Indonesian migrants came to Isabela, followed by three waves of Malays between 200 BC and 1500 AD.
                    Their descendants are the present-day Ibanag, Gaddang. Yogad, and other indigenous peoples who occupy the valleys and
                     foothills of Western Isabela where they built a civilization based on corn agriculture governed by the basic political
                      unit known as the barangay, <br> <br> &emsp; &emsp; In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Spaniards arrived in northern
                       Luzon and introduced the Christian religion, the encomienda system of government, and the tobacco monopoly.
                        Their 300-year rule was marked by oppression, which triggered several revolts in the 18th century led by local
                         chieftains Dabo and Marayag.<br> <br> &emsp; &emsp; Prior to 1839, the entire Cagayan Valley was one large
                 province which the Spanish insular government designated as La Provincia del Valle de Cagayan. To facilitate
                 the conversion of the natives to Catholic Christianity by Spanish missionaries, two provinces were created
                 in the vast territory, namely Cagayan and Nueva Vizcaya. The latter was established upon the advice of Cagayan's
                 alcalde mayor to Governor-General Luiz Lardizabal who issued an order in 1839 which was approved by a Spanish
                 royal decree on April 10, 1841. <br> <br> &emsp; &emsp; Another royal decree was issued on May 1, 1856,
                 creating Isabela de Luzon - as the province was initially called, distinguishing it from similarly named
                places in other parts of Las Islas Filipinas. The new province's name was derived from then reigning Queen
                 Isabella II of Spain. It consisted of nine towns of which were formerly part of Cagayan and seven others
                detached from Nueva Vizcaya. <br> <br> &emsp; &emsp; A new wave of migration started in the late 19th,
                with large numbers of Ilocanos from northwestern Luzon settling in Isabela. They were followed by other
                  ethnolinguistic groups, transforming the province into the "Melting Pot of the North." <br> <br> &emsp; &emsp;
                  During the Philippine-American War that followed the Philippine Revolution against Spain in the 1890's,
                the town of Palanan in Coastal Isabela figured prominently. There, on March 23, 1901, the first
                Philippine President, General Emilio Aguinaldo, was captured by US forces, signaling the end of 
                 America's first war as a colonial power. Under US rule, changes were instituted in the political 
                system but the economy of Isabela remained agricultural. <br> <br> &emsp; &emsp; The Japanese
                occupation of Isabela began in 1942 and lasted up to 1945, when the entire country was liberated
                 by Filipino and American forces at the end of the World War II. Thereafter the Philippines became
                an independent republic in 1946. <br> <br> &emsp; &emsp; From the late 20th century to the
                 turn of the millennium, Isabela continued to grow as a premier province of the Philippines.
                In 1994, Santiago became an independent component city followed by Cauayan in 2001
                and Ilagan in 2012.</p>
