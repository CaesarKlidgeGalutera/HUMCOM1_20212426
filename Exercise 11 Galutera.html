       <p class="pstyle1">Image by Scottshak</p>
       <p class="pstyle2">The science fiction action adventure "Ready Player One," based on Ernest Cline's best-selling novel of the same name, 
           is directed by Steven Spielberg. The year is 2045, and the world is on the verge of anarchy and catastrophe. The OASIS, a vast virtual
            reality realm built by the brilliant and eccentric James Halliday, has provided redemption to the people (Mark Rylance). When Halliday dies,
             he offers his vast fortune to the first person who discovers a digital Easter egg he has buried somewhere in the OASIS, igniting a worldwide 
             competition. When Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan), an unusual young hero, chooses to enter the competition, he is thrown into a fast-paced, reality-bending
              treasure search through a surreal universe of intrigue.â€‹ This is my favorite movie because it is also my dream to be able to play in a vr world where you can be anyone.</p>

        <p class="pstyle1">Image by carmudi.com.ph</p>
        <p class="pstyle2"> Ilocos Empanada is a fried meal with veggies or papaya, skinless Vigan Longganisa,
             and egg that is orange-tinged. It's just a rice wrapper packed with various stuff that's deep-fried
              in very hot oil until crisp, then cooled for a few minutes. After chipping off the corner to reveal 
              the steaming-hot contents inside, the devouring begins. This is my favorite food because I love the crunchiness and perfectly paired with papaya and logganisa</p>

        <h3 class="styleh32">Apex Legends</h3>
        <p class="pstyle1">Image by Respawn Entertainment</p>
        <p class="pstyle2">Apex Legends is Respawn Entertainment's award-winning free-to-play Hero Shooter.
             In the next iteration of Hero Shooter and Battle Royale, master an ever-growing roster of legendary 
             characters with tremendous powers, and experience smart squad play and unique gameplay. Apex Legends is 
             an online multiplayer battle royale game in which three players form a team and use pre-made characters with
              unique abilities known as "Legends," similar to those found in hero shooters. Since the game's debut, alternate
               modes have been added that allow for single and two-player squads. This is my favorite game because I love how thrilling this game is and it is a fast phase game.</p>
