            <h2>About Isabela</h2>
            <img src="../images/Flag.png">
            <p> &emsp; &emsp; Isabela, officially the Province of Isabela  is the second largest province in the Philippines in
                 land area located in the Cagayan Valley region in Luzon. Its capital and largest local government
                  unit is the city of Ilagan. It is bordered by the provinces of Cagayan to the north, Kalinga to the
                   northwest, Mountain Province to the central-west, Ifugao and Nueva Vizcaya to the southwest, Quirino
                    and Aurora to the south, and the Philippine Sea to the east. <br><br> &emsp; &emsp; This primarily agricultural province
                     is the rice and corn granary of Luzon due to its plain and rolling terrain. In 2012, the province was
                      declared as the country's top producer of corn with 1,209,524 metric tons. Isabela was also declared the second-largest rice producer
                       in the Philippines and the Queen Province of the North. <br> <br> &emsp; &emsp; Isabela is the 10th richest province in the 
                  Philippines as of 2011. The province has four trade centers in the cities of Ilagan, Cauayan, Santiago and the
                  municipality of Roxas. Santiago City, one of Isabela's cities, is considered to have the fastest-growing local
                  economy in the entire Philippines. <br> <br>&emsp; &emsp; The province has a land area 
                of 13,102.05 square kilometers or 5,058.73 square miles. Its population as determined by
                 the 2020 Census was 1,697,050. This represented 46.04% of the total population of the Cagayan
                 Valley region, 2.73% of the overall population of the Luzon island group, or 1.56% of the entire
                 population of the Philippines. Based on these figures, the population density is computed at 130
                inhabitants per square kilometer or 335 inhabitants per square mile. <br> <br>&emsp; &emsp; Isabela
                 is home to, 1,593,566 people who are distinguished for their resilience and diligence.
                  Majority of them are classified as Ilocanos, who constitute 69% of total households. Two other
                 prominent ethnolinguistic groups are Ibanag at 14% and Tagalog at 10%. The balance of 7% belongs
                 to the Gaddang, Paranan, Yogad, and other indigenous tribes. their ethnic differences notwithstanding,
                Isabeleños demonstrate a close kinship that allows for great ease when challenging times call for
                unity, cooperation, and service to family and their community. <br> <br>&emsp; &emsp; Isabela has
                 one of the highest literacy rates in the world at 97%. Most Isabeleños, especially those in the
                  urban centers, speak and understand both English and Filipino. Isabela's attractive suburban
                   lifestyle has steadily been attracting retirees of foreign descent. as well as Bicolanos,
                    Visayans, and Filipinos from other regions, contributing to the fluency of Isabeleños in other
                 languages and local dialects, and to interesting inter-regional cultural blends that are most evident
                 in the lifestyle and culinary practices of the locals. </p>
