                <p><Font face = "Consolas">&emsp; Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (also known as Mobile Legends, ML, or MLBB) has been around for five years and shows no signs of slowing down.

                    The Moonton-developed mobile multiplayer-online based arena (MOBA) game, which was first released in November 2016, has grown to become one of the most popular mobile esports games in 2021.
                    
                    With an average of 100,000 concurrent viewers in its major competitions, some fans believe it can compete with the largest PC Esports titles.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &emsp; But, in reality, how huge is the game?
                    
                    ML had over one billion installs in early 2020, with an average monthly active player population of over 100 million. In the Philippines alone, there are about 100 million registered users and 25 million monthly active users.</Font>

            <ul><Font face = "Consolas">
                <ln>- Mobile Legends pits two teams of five against one other, with the main goal of destroying the opponent's base.</ln>
                <br>
                <ln>- Each player chooses a hero at the start of the game. Each hero has his or her own set of characteristics and abilities. In the game, there are 92 heroes divided into six categories: tank, fighter, assassin, marksman, support, and mage.</ln>
                <br>
                <ln>- Players' obligations for their respective teams are determined by these roles. Support heroes, for example, have the ability to enhance or heal their teammates. That is why, in order to keep their comrades alive or strong in war, they need stick with them.</ln>
                <br>
                <ln>- Players must also destroy enemy forces, notably computer-controlled minions, turrets, and heroes, in order to level up their heroes. They will be rewarded in-game if you do so.</ln>

            <h2><Font face = "Candara">Popularity of Mobile Legends</Font></h2>
            <p><Font face = "Consolas">
                &emsp; Since its first release, the game has supposedly accumulated over 500 million downloads and 75 million active players. Southeast Asia, where the game has established itself as a significant esport, accounts for a large portion of its popularity.
            
            The MLBB Professional League, for example, is a Mobile Legends esports league in the Philippines. It just finished its fourth season, with Sunsparks taking home the championship and the majority of the $54,000 prize fund.  
            Meanwhile, MLBB LIGA, a street fight event where fans compete for rewards and bragging rights, caters to non-professional players.
            
            The MLBB World Championship 2019, or M1, takes place outside of the country and comprises 16 professional teams from 14 different countries.
